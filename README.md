# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my expertise as a full-stack developer and my passion for creating immersive 3D content. Built with **ReactJS** and **Three.js**, this portfolio is designed to highlight my technical skills, project work, and 3D design capabilities.

## Overview:
This portfolio is more than just a collection of my work; it is an interactive experience that reflects my ability to integrate complex technologies with a user-centric approach. The core of this project lies in its use of **Three.js**, enabling stunning 3D animations that engage viewers and set my portfolio apart. Combined with **ReactJS**, the application maintains a seamless and reactive user experience, showcasing dynamic content updates and interactive elements.

## Features:
- **3D Visuals and Animations**: The portfolio includes custom 3D models and animations that demonstrate my proficiency in using Three.js for web-based graphics. Visitors can interact with these 3D components, offering a unique and captivating browsing experience.
- **Responsive and Adaptive Design**: The entire site is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal performance and display on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Project Showcases**: Each project I have developed is featured with detailed descriptions, technology stacks, and direct links to corresponding GitHub repositories for more in-depth exploration.
- **About Me and Contact Sections**: Viewers can learn more about my background, skills, and achievements. Contact options are integrated to facilitate easy communication and networking.
- **LinkedIn and Social Media Integration**: Stay connected with quick links to my LinkedIn profile and other platforms where I share updates on my work and 3D content.

## Technology Stack:
- **ReactJS**: Used for building a responsive and interactive front-end.
- **Three.js**: Leveraged for creating visually striking 3D graphics and animations.
- **CSS/Sass**: Styled for a modern, clean, and user-friendly interface.
